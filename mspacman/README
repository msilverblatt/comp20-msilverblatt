Lab 6: Ms. Pac Man

In this lab, I created a canvas with a background using html and css. The background the the pacman board from the Google Doodle. I then rendered an image of ms pac man and of a ghost onto the canvas from the sprite sheet using javascript calls. I used w3schools to look up some javascript calls. 

This lab took me about 45 minutes.
