Assignment 2: Frogger
Michael Silverblatt

For this assignment I learned how to draw objects onto a html5 canvas using javascript. I first drew filled rectangles for the background water and road, then I sliced the sprite sheet and drew the appropriate images on the screen. I am writing functions for each sprite image so that I can draw a new one by calling a function and giving it only the x and y coordinates where I want it to go. Everything works and is ready to be continued on in assignment 3.

This assignment took me 2 hours.
