Comp 20 Assignment 3: Where in the world is...
README

In this project, I implemented a web page which renders a google map centered on your location (defaulting to the center of the MBTA map). Layered on this map are a marker denoting your location, T icons for every MBTA Red Line stop, icons marking the locations of Waldo and Carmen Sandiego (if they are around) and a polyline connecting all of the T stop markers. When you click on a T marker, it displays in a table all of the trains arriving in the near future. When you click on your own icon, it tells you which stop is closest to you and the distance between you and Waldo/Carmen Sandiego. Everything works as designed on my local machine with safari and firefox, but for some reason when running off of Kublai on occasion it will render the map and nothing else.

I used some code from your examples to get AJAX requests working and I took most of my distance function from the StackExchange discussion linked to on the assignment page.

I spent ~6 hours on this assignment.
